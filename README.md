# SF-Crime

As I'm moving to San Francisco next year, I thought it would be interesting to analyze and predict the nature of crime occurrances in the city. Hopefully this will help my decision process as I begin the apartment hunting process!

The dataset here is comprised of historical crime data from the SFPD Crime Incidence Reporting system, ranging from January 1st, 2003 to March 13, 2015.
